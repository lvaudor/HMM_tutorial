# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a short book about Hidden Markov Models, their principles, and how they can be fitted and applied in practical cases.

It is organised in 4 chapters:

1.  The **introduction** explains the principle of Hidden Markov Models through a simple probabilistic model involving boxes and balls.

2.  The **fitting** part explains how a Hidden Markov Model is fit to an observed series of data to estimate its parameters.

3.  The **hidden states** part explains how Hidden Markov Model are used to predict the hidden states behind a series of observations.

4.  The **case studies** part shows how Hidden Markov Models can be used in two instances: one is the interpretation of geomorphic series along a river, the second is the interpretation of discursive content.
